## How to use GIT:

1 - Open the “Git Bash”. Using the command line: Navigate to the folder that you want to create a new project. Ex: c:\documents\projects. Execute the command:

    git init newblog
  
    *(Where newblog is the name of the project)

The GIT will create an empty new folder named “newblog”. Your repository is created.
Navigate to the “newblog” folder; See the git display shows the folder that you are into, and at the end of the line shows “(master)”;  Master is the branch which controls the changes in the files.

2 -  To include files to control. (Do the test below to see what happens). On Windows, navigate to the “newblog” folder and create two files: document01.txt and document02.txt, come back to the git command line and execute the commands:

    git add document01.txt

    git add document02.txt

    OR

    git add .

    *(to include all files inside the folder to the repository)

3 – Commit these changes:

    git commit –m”first commit”

4 – To create a new branch execute the command:

    git checkout -b test01

    *(Where test01 is the name of the new branch)

5 – See the git display showing “(test01)

On Windows, navigate to the “newblog” folder and delete one of the files and execute the command:

    git status

See, GIT shows you the change made.

6 -  Commit this change:

  git commit –a –m”file deleted”

7 – On Windows, navigate to the “newblog” folder, keep your eyes in this folder and execute the command in the git bash:

  git checkout master

    *see what happen

    git checkout test01

    *see what happen

So, this test shows how to create a new branch, and it is useful to control your changes, you can work in a parallel branch, and keep the master branch running.

8 – When you finish your changes in the parallel branch, you can merge the changes to the master branch:

    git checkout master
    git merge test01
