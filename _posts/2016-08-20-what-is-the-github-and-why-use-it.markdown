### What is GitHub?

In the previous post, I explained a little bit about Git, to understand GitHub you must understand Git first. GitHub is a Git repository service. It means, a code hosting platform for version control. Also, GitHub is a collaboration service, which provides the tools for people to collaborate on a project or work together, even though they are not in the same place.

### Why GitHub?

Github is a powerful tool to individual projects even to a huge project with many developers, some people might say that GitHub is social networking for developers, and it is also true.

Firstly, it keeps the code save on cloud.

Second, it is easy for versioning the code, keep the control of all phases of the project also, helps to check the differences between revisions.

Furthermore, it allows other developers to copy the code to their local machine, and make changes. With this functionality, the developer can share their codes, ask for improvement or help for the GitHub users, to merge the changes in the main project, it is necessary that who made the changes ask for the owner of the project to merge it. This process makes the collaboration between many users, be very safe for the owner of the code, who can check all changes before the merge it.
An interesting about GitHub is the tool called “Watch”; It means that when you are following a project; You can get the updates of this project.
As a social networking, you can “like” a project which you think is good, giving it a Star. 

### How GitHub works?

Repository: When someone creates a repository, they become an owner of this project. By default, the main branch is named “master”.

Branching: It is the way to make changes in the code, creating a “copy” of the master branch. This process allows us to make changes and keep the master branch running without the changes until the work is finished.

Fork: As a collaboration service, any GitHub user can copy your project, make changes which don’t affect the master branch. When all changes are done, the user who made the changes has to ask for the owner of the project to accept their changes. 

Pull request: Once the work is done. Using the pull request a collaborator who made changes in the project, asks the owner of the project to include the modifications. It is a decision of the owner to include them or not.

So. GitHub can be useful to you and your project. Why do not check it out?
